## Books

- [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html?country=Portugal&discount_code=VAT20) - Zero To Production is the ideal starting point for your journey as a Rust backend developer. You will learn by doing: you will build a fully functional email newsletter API, starting from scratch.
- [Command-Line Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/) - Rather than focusing on the language as a whole, this guide teaches Rust using a single small, complete, focused program in each chapter. Author Ken Youens-Clark shows you how to start, write, and test each of these programs to create a finished product. You'll learn how to handle errors in Rust, read and write files, and use regular expressions, Rust types, structs, and more.
